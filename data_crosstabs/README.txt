Note: The file adult.csv in this module is directly from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).  In order to make the file easier to work with in pandas I added column headers to the CSV based on the descriptions from the aforementioned website.
